Installing Vlad

1. Prerequisites/requirements.
	i. OS X / Linux. Vlad was developed on OS X and runs on both OS X and Linux. 
	Should be runnable in any Unix-like OS.
	ii. Python 2.7. Might also run under 2.4.
	iii. GraphViz. Vlad draws graphs by calling the dot program, which is part of 
	GraphViz. (www.graphviz.org)

2. Unpackage the vlad-xxx.tar.gz file:
	$ gunzip vlad-1.5.2.tar.gz
	$ tar xf vlad-1.5.2.tar

3. Configure and install vlad in a web-accessible directory. 
   See instructions in config.default.
   	$ cd vlad
	$ cp config.defaults config.cfg
	$ emacs config.cfg
	    ... edit ...
	$ python Install config.cfg

4. At this point, you should be able to point your browser at the URL you configured, 
and see Vlad's query form.


Tip: To get started, leave the data configuration for later. Get Vlad 
installed and working with just the included sample files, then go back and
edit configuration to use your own data files. When you change the config, you
need to rerun Install.

Tip: You can also run Vlad from the command line. For example:
	$ cd www-vlad/libvlad 	# or wherever you installed it
	$ python Vlad.py -h	# to get help showing all options

	# example invocation
	$ python Vlad.py -g ../config.cfg -o ../sampledata/ontologies/gene_ontology.obo -a ../sampledata/annotationSets/gene_association.mgi -f ../sampledata/querySets/dnaRepairGenes.mgi -D .
